| morpho-graphs | meta-notations | fricative / affricate  | unrounded vowels |
| ç, θ | ʒ, ǎ, ě, ǐ, ǒ, ǔ | ś, ć, ź | ä, ë, ï, ö, ü |

```
ʒ, θ, ç, 
ś, ć, ź,
ǎ, ě, ǐ, ǒ, ǔ,

The International Standard Romani aphabet was devised by Romani linguist Marcel Courthiade and adopted by the International Romani Union at the Fourth Romani World Congress in Warsaw, Poland in April 1990.
