# Romani Keyboard (IRU Standard)
*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [Rromani](README.rom.md), [Română](README.ro.md).*

This project provides custom International Standard Romani keyboard layouts for Windows and MacOS systems, allowing easy access to the following special characters: 

| morpho-graphs | meta-notations | fricative / affricate  | unrounded vowels |
|----|----|----|----|
| ç, θ | ʒ, ǎ, ě, ǐ, ǒ, ǔ | ś, ć, ź | ä, ë, ï, ö, ü |

The International Standard Romani aphabet was devised by Romani linguist Marcel Courthiade and adopted by the International Romani Union at the Fourth Romani World Congress in Warsaw, Poland in April 1990.
